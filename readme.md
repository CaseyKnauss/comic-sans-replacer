Comic Sans Replacer
===================

This Chrome, Firefox, Opera and IE user style sheet replaces the ugly Comic Sans MS font on all websites with the brand new [Comic Neue](http://comicneue.com) by Craig Rozynski.

Installation
------------

First, download just the _userContent.css_ file (and _manifest.json_ only for Chrome).

In Chrome, go to _chrome:extensions_, enable the _Developer mode_ and install the unpacked extension from the folder containing these two files.

In Firefox, go to _about:support_ and click _Open Directory_. Create a new folder _chrome_ and paste the _userContent.css_ file into it.

In Opera, click _View > Style > Manage Modes_ and choose the _userContent.css_ file.

In Internet Explorer, click _Internet Options > Accessibility > Format documents using my stylesheet_ and browse for the _userContent.css_ file.
